# Tic Tac Toe

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game! This project, built with JavaScript, allows you to play the classic game with a twist. Not only can you make your moves as usual, but you can also "go back in time" and revisit past moves. 

## Features

- Classic Gameplay: Play Tic Tac Toe against a friend or an AI opponent. Take turns marking your symbols on the board and aim to get three in a row.
- Time Travel: Use the "Time Travel" feature to review previous moves and see how the game unfolded. Analyze your strategy or simply enjoy the journey through the game's history.
- Simple and Expandable: This project serves as a foundation for more complex and visually appealing versions of Tic Tac Toe. You can build upon this codebase to add more features and enhance the game.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript: The game logic and interactivity are implemented using JavaScript, a versatile programming language for web development.
- HTML/CSS: The user interface is built with HTML for the structure and CSS for the styling, providing a clean and intuitive design.

Feel free to explore the code, customize it, and use it as a starting point for your own projects. Let the games begin!
